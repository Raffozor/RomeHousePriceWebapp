            "During an internship experience in Lisbon, I discovered my passion for Data Science, working with Python "
            "to help the business migrate from data analysis on Excel to Python.")
st.markdown("During that time, I became friend with some students "
            "in Data Science and I was captivated by their field of study and have had the goal of becoming a Data "
            "Scientist ever since. I am fascinated by"
            " Python and its endless libraries, which have become my tool of choice for Data Science.")
st.markdown("I appreciate the "
            "flexibility, simplicity,and versatility of Python, which allow me to work on every phase of a Data Science"
            " project. I can collect data through web scraping and get as far as putting machine learning models into "
            "production, such as this web-app on Streamlit.")
st.markdown("I decided to develop this project as a personal exercise "
            "to improve my skills in all phases of the data process. In the section dedicated to the model, "
            "I explain in detail the work done.")
st.markdown("I look forward to tackling real Data Science projects, and I hope this "
